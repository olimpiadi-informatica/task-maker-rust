//! The `italian_yaml` format is defined by [`cms`](https://cms.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4/External%20contest%20formats.html#italian-import-format)
//! and it's the most used format in the Italian Olympiads.
//!
//! # `gen/GEN` format
//! Here it's provided the definition of the format of the `gen/GEN` file, as interpreted by
//! task-maker. The aim is to be as compatible as possible to the format accepted by `cmsMake` and
//! `cmsImportTask`.
//!
//! The `gen/GEN` file describes how the input files of the testcases should be generated and how
//! the subtasks are composed. The formal definition of the format can be found looking at the
//! [parsing grammar](https://github.com/edomora97/task-maker-rust/blob/master/task-maker-format/src/ioi/format/italian_yaml/GEN.pest).
//! The format is described here informally.
//!
//! Each line of that file can be of one of the following types:
//!
//! - if the line starts with `# ` (number sign followed by a space) it is a comment and will be
//!   ignored. Example: `# this is a comment`
//! - if the line starts with `#ST:` it is the marker of the start of a new subtask. Following the
//!   column there is the score of the subtask, an integer number. Example: `#ST: 20`, meaning that
//!   all the following testcases, before the next `#ST:` are grouped in a single subtask worth 20
//!   points.
//! - if the line starts with `#COPY:` it is a testcase with a static input file, meaning that the
//!   input file will be simply copied from the path specified after the column. Example:
//!   `#COPY: gen/hardcoded.in`. The path is relative to the task root directory and the file must
//!   exists and be readable from task-maker. The path should not contain spaces.
//! - non-empty lines not starting with `#` defines a new testcases each. Each line contains
//!   command line arguments to pass to the generator executable. The generator should be named
//!   `gen/generator.*` or `gen/generatore.*`. Example: `1 2 3`, the generator will be invoked
//!   passing the three arguments.
//!
//! If a line contains a `#`, all the characters following it (`#` included) will be ignored as they
//! are considered comments. Example: `1 2 3 # inline comment`.
//!
//! If no `#ST` lines are present, a single subtask worth 100 points is automatically added.
//!
//! ## Full example of `gen/GEN`
//!
//! ```text
//! # N     M       seed
//! #ST: 0
//! #COPY: gen/example1.txt
//! #COPY: gen/example2.txt
//!
//! #ST: 30
//! 10      1000    101
//! 20      1000    102
//! 1       1       103 # corner case!
//!
//! #ST: 70
//! 1000    10000   201
//! 2000    10000   202
//! ```
//!
//! In this example the first line is ignored since it's a comment, then the definition of a subtask
//! of zero points starts. The content of that subtask are 2 hardcoded input files, for example the
//! sample cases in the text statement.
//!
//! Then a new subtask of 30 points starts, it's composed of 3 testcases. Note that the comment on
//! the third will be ignored and just the 3 numbers will be passed to the generator.
//!
//! Then there is a third subtask with 2 testcases.
//!
//! # `gen/cases.gen` format
//!
//! The `gen/GEN` format is pretty limited regarding some important aspects of task preparation. For
//! example it allows you to use just a single generator and a single validator. A new format, not
//! yet officially supported by `cms` (but workaround exists!), is here described.
//!
//! The formal definition of the format can be found in the
//! [parsing grammar](https://github.com/edomora97/task-maker-rust/blob/master/task-maker-format/src/ioi/format/italian_yaml/cases.gen.pest).
//! An informal explanation is here provided.
//!
//! Similarly to `gen/GEN`, each line is independent and can be one of the following:
//! - if it starts with `#` it is a comment and will be ignored.
//! - if it starts with `:` it is a command and what follows is described below.
//! - otherwise if it does not start with `#` nor `:`, it's a simple testcase definition. The
//!   testcases will be generated using the _current generator_, which is either the default one or
//!   the overridden one in the current subtask.
//!
//! If a line contains a `#`, all the characters following it (`#` included) will be ignored as they
//! are considered comments. Example: `1 2 3 # inline comment`.
//!
//! ## Backwards compatibility with cms
//! Since the importers of cms do not yet support the `cases.gen` format, there is a workaround that
//! works as follows: when the task is built task-maker will create a _fake_ `gen/GEN` with just the
//! metadata needed by `cmsImportTask` (like the number of testcases and subtasks).
//!
//! This file also contains some comments that may be found useful for debugging the generations.
//!
//! That file will be ignore by task-maker if the `cases.gen` file is present and will be removed
//! with `--clean`. Note that you should not edit that file because it will be overwritten the next
//! time task-maker will be launched. To keep that file you should remove the comment containing
//! `tm-allow-delete`.
//!
//! ## `cases.gen` commands
//! The lines starting with a column `:` are commands. What follows the column is the actual command
//! which can be of many types.
//!
//! ### `: GEN name path [args...]`
//! This command registers a new generator for the task. The generator is referenced in the file
//! with the specified `name`, a unique string without spaces. That generator's source file will be
//! found at the specified `path`. The optional following `args...` define the command line
//! arguments of this generator, they will be used for validating the constraints (see below).
//!
//! If the name is `default` the generator will be considered the default one and will be used when
//! no specific generator is selected.
//!
//! Example: `: GEN default gen/generator.py N M seed` defines the _default_ generator for the task,
//! whose source file is at `gen/generator.py` (relative to the task's root directory) and will
//! accept 3 arguments named `N`, `M` and `seed`. When this generator will be used the variables
//! `$N`, `$M` and `$seed` will be set and available for the constraint evaluation.
//!
//! Example: `: GEN line gen/line.py` defines a new generator named `line` whose parameters are not
//! known and won't be validated.
//!
//! ### `: VAL name path [args...]`
//! This command registers a new validator for the task. The semantics of the command are the same
//! of `: GEN name path [args...]`, including the behaviour of the `default` name.
//!
//! If no arguments are specified for the validator the default behaviour is to pass the variables
//! `$INPUT` and `$ST_NUM` (similar to `gen/GEN`, but the subtask is 0-based).
//!
//! Note that, differently than `: GEN` the arguments of the validator do not define new variables,
//! instead defines which parameters task-maker will pass to the validator. Because of that the
//! variables should be prefixed with `$` (the variables are used, not declared).
//!
//! Note that the `name` must be unique among the validators, but it can be the same of the one of
//! a generator.
//!
//! Example: `: VAL default gen/validator.py` defines the _default_ validator for the task.
//!
//! Example: `: VAL line gen/val_line.py $INPUT $ST_NUM` defines the `line` validator which takes 2
//! arguments, the same as the default behaviour, but using the variables to specify them.
//!
//! ### `: GEN name`
//! This command overrides the default generator for the current subtask, meaning that all the
//! testcases in the current subtask, following this command, will use the generator named `name` by
//! default. A generator named `name` must have been previously defined.
//!
//! Example: `: GEN line` sets the current generator to `line`.
//!
//! ### `: VAL name`
//! This command overrides the default validator for the current subtask, meaning that all the
//! testcases in the current subtask, following this command, will use the validator named `name`.
//! A validator named `name` must have been previously defined.
//!
//! Example: `: VAL line` sets the current validator to `line`.
//!
//! ### `: CONSTRAINT operand (operator operand)+`
//! This command adds a constraint that validates the parameters of the testcases. The arguments of
//! `: CONSTRAINT` form an expression that is an inequality (with equalities allowed) between
//! constants and variables. When a testcase is defined using a generator with the arguments known,
//! all those variables become defined and will be checked with all the constraints.
//!
//! The operators available are: < <= > >= =, but note that the inequalities must have the same
//! direction (cannot mix < and >).
//!
//! Constraints defined before the first subtask will be used for all the subtasks. Constraints
//! defined inside a subtask will be used only for that subtask.
//!
//! Example: `:CONSTRAINT 0 <= $N < $M <= 1000000` will check that the variables `$N` and `$M` are
//! between 0 and 1000000 and `$N` is smaller than `$M`.
//!
//! ### `: SUBTASK score [name]`
//! This command marks the start of a new subtask, just like how `#ST` in `gen/GEN` did. The score
//! can be a simple floating point number (either an integer or an integer.integer). The name
//! that follows is optional and will be included in the subtask metadata.
//!
//! When a new subtask is started the generator and validator will be reset to the default ones.
//!
//! Example: `: SUBTASK 40 all-the-nodes-are-in-a-line` defines a new subtask worth 40 points, with
//! the provided name.
//!
//! ### `: COPY path`
//! This command creates a new testcase coping the input file from the specified path, relative to
//! the task root directory. The file will be validated using the current validator of the subtask.
//!
//! Example: `: COPY gen/hardcoded.in`
//!
//! ### `: RUN name args...`
//! This command creates a new testcase using the generator named `name`, passing to it the
//! following arguments. The generator must have been previously defined.
//!
//! If the generator has the definition of its parameters, they will be used for assigning the
//! variables for checking the constraints. All the constraints must be satisfied for each testcase.
//!
//! The arguments provided are parsed with a shell lexer, meaning that `"` and `'` have a semantic
//! value (the same as a shell). Unlike `gen/GEN` you can pass arguments with a space in it using
//! the quotes.
//!
//! Example: `: RUN line 1 2 3` will run the `line` generator passing the three integers as
//! arguments.
//!
//! ## Testcase definition
//! Similarly to `gen/GEN` lines that are not commands nor comments are simple testcase definition.
//! Their semantics is the same of `: RUN default args...`.
//!
//! ## Automatic variables
//! In the constraint evaluation and in the validator argument specification all the variables
//! obtained from the parsing of the generator's arguments will be available. Also some automatic
//! variables will be available:
//! - `$ST_NUM`: the 0-based index of the subtask
//! - `$ST_NAME`: the name of the subtask
//! - `$INPUT` _(only for validators)_: the name of the file to validate
//!
//! ## Full example of `cases.gen`
//! ```text
//! : GEN default gen/generator.py N M seed
//! : GEN line gen/line.py N seed
//! : GEN hard gen/hard.py
//!
//! : VAL default gen/validator.py
//! : VAL line gen/val_line.py $INPUT $ST_NUM # same as default
//!
//! : CONSTRAINT 1 <= $N <= 1000
//! : CONSTRAINT 1 <= $M <= 1000000
//!
//! : SUBTASK 0 examples
//! : COPY gen/example1.in
//! : COPY gen/example2.in
//!
//! : SUBTASK 30 nodes-are-in-a-line
//! : GEN line
//! : VAL line
//! : CONSTRAINT $N <= 500
//! 500   101
//! 500   102
//!
//! : SUBTASK 70
//! 1000   1000      201
//! 1000   1000000   202
//! : RUN hard 1000 1000 95% 12.3 203
//! ```
//!
//! In this example 3 generators and 2 validators are defined, named `default`, `line`, `hard` and
//! `default`, `line` respectively. The `default` and `line` generators have their parameters
//! specified, they will be used for the constraints check; the `hard` generator arguments won't be
//! validated.
//!
//! Note that the second validator has the arguments specified, and they are the same as the default
//! ones. Also note that the inline comment will be ignored.
//!
//! This file defines 3 subtasks, worth 0, 30 and 70 points each.
//!
//! The first subtask contains 2 testcases whose file will be simply copied from the specified
//! paths.
//!
//! The second subtask has 2 testcases each generated with the `line` generator and validated with
//! the `line` validator. Note that there is an additional constraint for the subtask, it will be
//! checked only in this subtask.
//!
//! The third subtask will use the `default` generator and validator, except for the last testcase
//! which will use the `hard` one. Note that since the `hard` generator does not have the argument
//! specification, its parameters won't be checked. Also note that the constraint `$N <= 500` won't
//! be checked because it was scoped only to the second subtask.
//! The subtask also does not have a name, the default one (`subtask2`) will be used.
